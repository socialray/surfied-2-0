myCRED is an adaptive points management system that lets you award / charge your users for interacting with your WordPress powered website.

== Description ==

> #### Plugin Support
> Free support is offered  via the [myCRED support forum](http://mycred.me/support/forums/). No support is provided here on the wordpress.org website.

myCRED is a adaptive points management tool to help you build reward programs, monetize your website or just reward users with points for posting comments or publishing content.

Packed with features, myCRED also supports some of the most popular WordPress plugins like WooCommerce, BuddyPress, Jetpack, Contact Form 7 and [more](http://mycred.me/about/supported-plugins/).


= Points =

Each user on your WordPress websites gets their own point balance which you can manually [adjust](http://mycred.me/about/features/easy-manual-adjustments/) at any time. As of version 1.4, myCRED also supports multiple point types for those who need more then one type of points on their website.


= Log =

Each time myCRED adds or deducts points from a user, the adjustment is [logged](http://mycred.me/about/features/the-log/) in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. The log is also used to provide you with statistics or enforce limits you set.


= Awarding or Deducting Points Automatically =

myCRED supports a vast set of ways you can automatically give / take points from a user. Everything from new comments to store purchases. These automatic adjustments are managed by so called Hooks which you can setup in your admin area.


= Third-party plugin Support =

myCRED supports some of the most [popular plugins](http://mycred.me/about/supported-plugins/) for WordPress like BuddyPress, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Contact Form 7 etc. To prevent to much cluttering in the admin area with settings, myCRED will automatically hide settings for plugins that you are not using.


= Add-ons =

There is so much more to myCRED then just adjusting balances. The plugin comes with several [built-in add-ons](http://mycred.me/add-ons/) which enabled more complex features such as allowing point transfers, buying points for real money, allow payments in stores etc.

To help fund development of myCRED, I also provide an ever growing set of [premium add-ons](http://mycred.me/store/) that brings you even more features or add support for more payment gateways.


= Documentation =

The myCRED [Codex](http://codex.mycred.me/) provides a large amount of documentation for users and developers. You can also find installation guides on each add-ons page on the myCRED.me website.


= Support =

I provide free technical support via the [myCRED website](http://mycred.me/support/forums/). Support is **NOT** provided here on the wordpress.org support forum. This also means I do not provide support for forks or clones of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does myCRED support Multisite Installations? =

Yep! myCRED also offers you the option to centralize your log or enforce your main sites installation on all sub sites via the "Master Template" feature.

= Can I as an administrator adjust my users balances? =

Yes of course. Administrators have full access to all users point types, balances and history.

= Does myCRED support Multiple Point Types? =

Yes! myCRED as of version 1.4 officially supports multiple point types. You can setup an unlimited number of point types with it's own settings, available hooks and log page for each administration. Note that add-ons have limited support. Please consult the myCRED website for more information.

= What point formats does myCRED support? =

myCRED supports whole numbers or the use of decimals (max 20 decimal places). You can setup to use both if you use mutliple point types however the default point type must be set to use the highest number of decimal places.

= How many point types does myCRED support? =

There is no built-in limit for how many point types you can setup, however, with that being said, I do not recommend more then 5-6 types. Remember that myCRED will add an admin menu for each point type so with large sets of point types, you will have a very long admin menu.

= Can users use points to pay for items in my store? =

Yes, myCRED supports WooCommerce, MarketPress and WP E-Commerce straight out of the box. If you want users to pay for event tickets myCRED also supports Events Manger and Event Espresso.

= Can myCRED award points for users sharing posts on social media sites? =

No. myCRED does not support this but there are WordPress plugins out there that can provide this functionality with support for myCRED.

= Can I award points for watching videos? =

Yes. myCRED supports YouTube out of the box and you can purchase the video add-on to add support for Vimeo as well. myCRED uses iframes for videos making video watching possible on portable devices as well.

= Can I import / export log entries? =

myCRED supports importing, exporting, inline editing and manual deletion of log entires as of version 1.4.
